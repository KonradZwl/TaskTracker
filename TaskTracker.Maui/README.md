# First MAUI App
This is a simple MAUI app that allows the user to track the time spend on a task
As a developer myself, I often find myself working on a task and losing track of time.
This app will help me keep track of the time I spend on a task.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
- Visual Studio 2022
- .NET 8 SDK
- MAUI Workload
